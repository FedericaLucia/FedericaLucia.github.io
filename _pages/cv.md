Education
======
* B.A. in Fine Arts, Hons, Academy of Fine Arts Brera, Milan, Italy, 2011
* M.S. in Computer Science, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2018
* Ph.D in Social Computing and Crowdsourcing, Human Centered Computing, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2019

Work experience
======
* July 2019--Present: Ph.D. student • Social Computing • Human-Centered Computing Group, Utrecht University, The Netherlands
  * Utilizing a range of statistical and human-computer interaction methods, I investigate the effectiveness of various manipulations, such as algorithms, frameworks, and user recommendations, on teamwork and collaboration in online work settings. In addition to my primary research focus, I am also actively involved in collaborating with researchers on a variety of other topics such as emotional support for groups and bringing a diverse range of skills to the team. I am also a lecturer in Python programming and HCI methods at both the bachelor's and master's levels and regularly present recent research at international conferences. I am frequently responsible for supervising students as they work on their theses and helping them with planning and motivation.

* March 2019—April 2019: Research Assistant • EarSense • Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK
  * I continued the work started in 2018 on the development of user-friendly low-power headphones for hands-off mobility. The work entailed the refinement of the signal processing with Python and C++ and the improvement of the hardware by iteratively researching optimal implementations.

* January 2019—February 2019: Research Assistant • Fake News • Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK
  * I researched unsupervised machine learning methodologies, specifically autoencoders and deep neural nets, for the classification of fake news in natural language generation. I also explored the use of rule-based metrics for hallucination detection.

* October 2018—November 2018: Research Assistant • EarSense • Napier University, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK
  * I assisted in the development of low-power movement-sensing in-ear headphones through the implementation of micro barometers. I was responsible for the design, conduct, and analysis of prototype testing, as well as the processing and extraction of data from the prototypes.

* June 2018—August 2018: Work Placement • Drug detection for the NHS • Wallscope, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK
  * I completed a work placement and Master’s thesis focused on the development of Machine Learning techniques. Specifically, I developed two artificial neural network models for drug named entity extraction in collaboration with the Information Service Division. I created one convolutional neural network (CNN) model and one recurrent neural network model (RNN), both trained on medical text, with the goal of visualizing prescriptions across GP practices in Scotland.

* March 2015—October 2018: Self-Employment• Federica Designs • Edinburgh, Scotland, UK
  * Artistic director of a micro-company focused on the production and marketing of sustainable, high-end furniture made in the UK. As part of my work, I collaborated with the Social Enterprise Edinburgh Remakery, the West Lothian Council, and the Dalkeith Primary School to promote recycling through classes and demonstrations.

* June 2013—March 2015: Business partner • Vinella & Krupa • Edinburgh, Scotland, UK
  * Co-founder of a small furniture restoration and upcycling business, I was driven towards the rediscovery of traditional furniture decorating techniques in particular etching and figurative painting. The company gained some Princes Trust awards and took part in numerous fairs and publications across the UK.
