### Hello! 
I am a creative, passionate, and self-driving (finishing) Ph.D. student in the field of **Social Computing** and **Crodsourcing**. I have a wide range of interests and abilities ranging from Python programming to product development and user research. I am known for being a great team player, who enjoys sharing knowledge and contributing to teamwork efforts. I value interdisciplinary work, effective communication, and incremental development.

In addition to my professional skills, I have a diverse range of interests and abilities that I bring to my work such as resilience, a positive and inclusive mindset, and an open-minded approach to solutions. I am excited to apply my unique perspective and passion to new challenges and opportunities.
