excerpt: 'In this paper, we propose a new approach, namely Self-Organizing Pairs (SOPs), which incorporates self organization
in algorithmic collaboration management, by facilitating workers to self-organize into effective pairs
while being supported—but not guided—by an algorithm. We compared SOPs with two baselines that do not allow
user agency, on a creative task of fictional story writing. Our findings indicate that the SOPs approach leads to creative
outputs of higher quality and to higher collaboration satisfaction. Our results have scientific, applied, and societal
implications.'

As the volume and complexity of distributed online work increases, collaboration among people who have never worked
together in the past is becoming increasingly necessary. Recent research has proposed algorithms to maximize the performance
of online collaborations by grouping workers in a top-down fashion and according to a set of predefined decision
criteria. This approach often means that workers have little say in the collaboration formation process. Depriving users of
control over whom they will work with can stifle creativity and initiative-taking, increase psychological discomfort, and,
overall, result in less-than-optimal collaboration results—especially when the task concerned is open-ended, creative, and
complex. In this work, we propose an alternative model, called Self-Organizing Pairs (SOPs), which relies on the crowd of
online workers themselves to organize into effective work dyads. Supported but not guided by an algorithm, SOPs are a new
human-centered computational structure, which enables participants to control, correct, and guide the output of their
collaboration as a collective. Experimental results, comparing SOPs to two benchmarks that do not allow user agency, and on
an iterative task of fictional story writing, reveal that participants in the SOPs condition produce creative outcomes of higher
quality, and report higher satisfaction with their collaboration. Finally, we find that similarly to machine learning-based selforganization,
human SOPs exhibit emergent collective properties, including the presence of an objective function and the
tendency to form more distinct clusters of compatible collaborators.
