excerpt: 'In this paper, we suggest the development of a symbiotic framework for real-time Emotional Support (ES) with social robots Knowledge Graphs (KG). By augmenting a domain-specific corpus from the literature on ES for children (between the age of 8 and 12) and providing scenario-driven context including the history of events, we suggest developing an experimental knowledge-aware ES framework.'

In current youth-care programs, children with needs (mental health, family issues, learning disabilities, and autism) receive support from youth and family experts as one-to-one assistance at schools or hospitals. Occasionally, social robots have featured in such settings as support roles in a one-to-one interaction with the child. In this paper, we suggest the development of a symbiotic framework for real-time Emotional Support (ES) with social robots Knowledge Graphs (KG). By augmenting a domain-specific corpus from the literature on ES for children (between the age of 8 and 12) and providing scenario-driven context including the history of events, we suggest developing an experimental knowledge-aware ES framework. The framework both guides the social robot in providing ES statements to the child and assists the expert in tracking and interpreting the child's emotional state and related events over time.
