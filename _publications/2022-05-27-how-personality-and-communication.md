excerpt: 'This study explores the dynamics
between 120 crowd participants paired into 60 virtual dyads and their collaboration
outcome during the execution of a high-pressure, time-bound task. Results show that
the personality trait of Openness to experience may impact team performance with
teams with higher minimum levels of Openness more likely to defuse the bomb on

Critical, time-bounded, and high-stress tasks, like incident response, have often been
solved by teams that are cohesive, adaptable, and prepared. Although a fair share of
the literature has explored the effect of personality on various other types of teams and
tasks, little is known about how it contributes to teamwork when teams of strangers
have to cooperate ad-hoc, fast, and efficiently. This study explores the dynamics
between 120 crowd participants paired into 60 virtual dyads and their collaboration
outcome during the execution of a high-pressure, time-bound task. Results show that
the personality trait of Openness to experience may impact team performance with
teams with higher minimum levels of Openness more likely to defuse the bomb on
time. An analysis of communication patterns suggests that winners made more use of
action and response statements. The team role was linked to the individualâ€™s preference
of certain communication patterns and related to their perception of the collaboration
quality. Highly agreeable individuals seemed to cope better with losing, and individuals
in teams heterogeneous in Conscientiousness seemed to feel better about collaboration
quality. Our results also suggest there may be some impact of gender on performance.
As this study was exploratory in nature, follow-on studies are needed to confirm these
results. We discuss how these findings can help the development of AI systems to aid
the formation and support of crowdsourced remote emergency teams.
