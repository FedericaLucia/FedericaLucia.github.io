Supervision of personal projects for the completion of the Bachelor studies in Information Technologies. Examples of supervised projects:

* The Effect of Moderation on Collaborative Problem-Solving Online
    * Moderation online, by a human or a chatbot, is a feature of text-based online chat that is becoming more common among online social community platforms.  This study aims to determine whether the moderation is effective for collaborative problem-solving.  Human and chatbot moderation is already effective in other areas, like education, entertainment, and visual debates.  In a series of experiments,  participants solved the moon landing game together and collaborated using a chat application and drop-down menu.  The study compared three conditions:  Human moderation, chatbot moderation, and no moderation.  The results indicate a significant increase in performance for the human and the non-moderated condition in the form of a higher score, word count, and the number of responses used.  There was no significant difference in performance between the chatbot condition and the non-moderated condition between the human and the chatbot condition.

* Towards prevention of unhealthy game usage for MMORPGs
    * Massive  Multiplayer  Online  Role-playing  Games  (MMORPGs)  are a  type of game that has raised serious issues due to their addictive nature.  Despite being only harmful to a small minority of players, researchers have indicated the need for preventive measures specific to this game genre.  This study looks into addiction prevention within the game context through the perception of the player.  It considers three categories of preventive measures: educational,  restrictive,  and embedded.  We collected the responses of 45 active MMORPG players who evaluated these measures based on effectiveness and their perception of annoyance.  The results showed that the participants perceived most educational methods as more effective than annoying.  The least aggravating intervention was the creation of educational articles followed by a conceptualized addiction rating.  Both were perceived as effective by around a quarter of the players.
