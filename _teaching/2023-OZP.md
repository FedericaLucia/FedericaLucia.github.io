Supervision of personal projects for the completion of the Bachelor studies in Information Technologies. Examples of supervised projects:

* Towards prevention of unhealthy game usage for MMORPGs
    * Massive  Multiplayer  Online  Role-playing  Games  (MMORPGs) tend to be frowned upon due to their addictive nature.  Despite being only harmful to a small minority of players, researchers have indicated the need for preventive measures specific to this game genre.  This study looks into addiction prevention within the game context through the player's viewpoint.  It considers three categories of preventive measures: educational,  restrictive,  and embedded.  From an online study using a Discord Server, we collected accounts from 45 active MMORPG players who evaluated the proposed measures based on effectiveness and annoyance.  The results showed that the participants perceived educational methods as effective instead of annoying.  They also tolerated the inclusion of articles to educate the players on the risks of addiction and metrics such as the conceptualized addiction rating. 

* The Effect of Moderation on Collaborative Problem-Solving Online
    * Moderation online, by a human or a chatbot, is a feature of text-based online chat that is becoming more common among online social community platforms.  This study aims to determine whether the moderation is effective for collaborative problem-solving.  Human and chatbot moderation is already effective in other areas, like education, entertainment, and virtual debates.  In a series of experiments,  participants solved the moon landing game together and collaborated using a chat application and drop-down menu.  The study compared three conditions:  Human moderation, chatbot moderation, and no moderation.  The results indicate that human moderation is significantly better at improving team performance compared to the chatbot and the non-moderated conditions.

* Data Mining Twitter Feeds: Analysing thesentiment towards remote work during theCOVID-19 Pandemic
    * This work explores the public sentiment of users from a collection of tweets regarding remote work and online collaborative tools. By gathering a variety of tweets using Tweepy,  we analyzed them with Sentiment Analysis tools such as TextBlob and Vader NLTK. The results show that users shared a positive attitude toward working from home, especially when analyzing tweets containing words such as zoom, remote work, and webinar. In this exploratory study, we present the aggregate results of our analysis using sentiment analysis and word clouds. We further discuss the use and limitations of out-of-the-box tools for general sentiment analysis for fine-grained and topic-specific research.
