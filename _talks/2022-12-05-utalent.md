About U-TALENT
U-Talent offers (beta) teachers, TOAs and school leaders activities aimed at deepening professional knowledge and expanding (subject) didactic insights. The activities thus offer tools for designing appealing and challenging education. All activities offer room for exchange with colleagues and encourage participants to put to work with what they have learned in their own lessons. The program has substantive input from Utrecht University, Hogeschool Utrecht and the business community.
